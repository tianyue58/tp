### Architecture

<img src="images/umldiagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/umldiagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/umldiagrams/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/umldiagrams/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ApplicationListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Application` object residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/umldiagrams/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `InternshipParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add an application).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/umldiagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/umldiagrams/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `InternshipParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `InternshipParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/umldiagrams/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the InternSHIP data i.e., all `Application` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueApplicationList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Application` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Application>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components).

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Requirement` set and `InterviewDateAndTime` set in the `Internship`, which `Application` references. This allows `Internship` to only require one `Requirement` object per unique requirement, and one `InterviewDateAndTime` object per unique `InterviewDateAndTime`, instead of each `Application` needing their own `Requirement` and `InterviewDateAndTime` objects.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/umldiagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/umldiagrams/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both InternSHIP data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `InternshipStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`).

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Complete feature
The `complete` command is modelled by the `Completion` class which represents the
'Completion' entity. The `Completion` field is also added as a private attribute to the
`Application` class. This field can take the following values:
* `Completed`
* `Uncompleted`

Note: When a new internship application is added, the value of the
`Completion` field is 'Uncompleted' by default.

The `Complete` command is facilitated by the `CompleteCommand` class. It extends the `Command` class
and implements the `CompleteCommand#execute` method which wraps the main
logic of the command. This command can be used to change the completion status of
the application from `Uncompleted` to `Completed`.

The `CompleteCommandParser` class is responsible for parsing the index received from the user. This
class implements the `Parser` interface. The `CompleteCommandParser#parse` method of
this class parses the index and returns an `CompleteCommand` object with the index
as the parameter.


Below is a sequence diagram and an explanation of how the `CompleteCommand` is executed.
![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `complete 1` Command](images/umldiagrams/CompleteSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 1. The user enters `complete 1` command in the main window.

Step 2. The command is handled by `LogicManager#execute` method, which then calls the `InternshipParser#parseCommand` method.

Step 3. `InternshipParser` matches the command word `complete` in the string and extracts the argument string `1`.

Step 4. `InternshipParser` then calls `CompleteCommandParser#parse` method and the argument string is converted to an Index instance.

Step 5. `CompleteCommandParser` creates a new `CompleteCommand` instance and returns it to `InternshipParser`, which in turn returns it to `LogicManager`.

Step 6. `LogicManager` then calls the `CompleteCommand#execute` method.

Step 7. Next, `CompleteCommand` object calls the `Model#setApplication` method with the application to complete and completed application
as arguments. It then returns a `CommandResult` object to the `LogicManager`.

Step 8. Finally, the `CommandResult` object is returned by the `LogicManager`.

#### Design considerations:

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only allow users to complete an existing application in the list
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: User cannot add an application that has already been completed.

* **Alternative 2:** Provide the option to specify the completion status of an application when it is first added to the list
    * Pros: Everything can be done in one shot.
    * Cons: The `add` command will require too many parameters.

### Accept feature

The `accept` command is modelled by the `Status` class which represents the
'Status' entity. The `Status` field is also added as a private attribute to the
`Application` class. This field can take the following values:
* `Pending`
* `Accepted`
* `Rejected`

Note: When a new internship application is added, the value of the
`Status` field is 'Pending' by default.

The `Accept` command is facilitated by the `AcceptCommand` class. It extends the `Command` class
and implements the `AcceptCommand#execute` method which wraps the main
logic of the command. This command can be used to change the status of
the application from `Pending` to `Accepted`. When the status changes, the application completion
field would change from `Uncompleted` to `Completed` automatically.

The `AcceptCommandParser` class is responsible for parsing the index received from the user. This
class implements the `Parser` interface. The `AcceptCommandParser#parse` method of
this class parses the index and returns an `AcceptCommand` object with the index
as the parameter.

Below is a sequence diagram and an explanation of how the `AcceptCommand` is executed.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `accept 2` Command](images/umldiagrams/AcceptSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 1. The user enters the `accept 2` command in the main window.

Step 2. The command is handled by the `LogicManager#execute` method, which then calls the `InternshipParser#parseCommand` method.

Step 3. `InternshipParser` matches the command word `accept` in the string and extracts the argument string `2`.

Step 4. `InternshipParser` then calls the `AcceptCommandParser#parse` method. In this method, it is ensured that the input is of the correct format, and the argument string is converted to an Index instance.

Step 5. If the index specified by the user is valid then the `AcceptCommandParser` creates a new `AcceptCommand` instance and returns it to `InternshipParser`, which in turn returns it to `LogicManager`.

Step 6. `LogicManager` then calls the `AcceptCommand#execute` method.

Step 7. Next, `AcceptCommand` object calls the `Model#setApplication` method with the application to accept and accepted application
as arguments. It then returns a `CommandResult` object to the `LogicManager`.

Step 8. Finally, the `CommandResult` object is returned by the `LogicManager`.

#### Design considerations:

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The default status when an application is added is `Pending`.
  It can later be changed to `Accepted` using the `accept` command.
    * Pros: Convenient for the user to use.
    * Cons: User cannot add an application whose status is already known.

* **Alternative 2:** Provide the ability to specify the status of an application at the time of adding.
    * Pros: Easy to specify the desired status field while adding an application.
    * Cons: The `add` command will require too many parameters.

### Reject feature

The `reject` command is modelled by the `Status` class which represents the
'Status' entity. The `Status` field is also added as a private attribute to the
`Application` class. This field can take the following values:
* `Pending`
* `Accepted`
* `Rejected`

Note: When a new internship application is added, the value of the
`Status` field is 'Pending' by default.

The `Reject` command is facilitated by the `RejectCommand` class. It extends the `Command` class
and implements the `RejectCommand#execute` method which wraps the main
logic of the command. This command can be used to change the status of
the application from `Pending` to `Rejected`. When the status changes, the application completion
field would change from `Uncompleted` to `Completed` automatically.

The `RejectCommandParser` class is responsible for parsing the index received from the user. This
class implements the `Parser` interface. The `RejectCommandParser#parse` method of
this class parses the index and returns an `RejectCommand` object with the index
as the parameter.

Below is a sequence diagram and an explanation of how the `RejectCommand` is executed.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `reject 2` Command](images/umldiagrams/RejectSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 1. The user enters the `reject 2` command in the main window.

Step 2. The command is handled by the `LogicManager#execute` method, which then calls the `InternshipParser#parseCommand` method.

Step 3. `InternshipParser` matches the command word `reject` in the string and extracts the argument string `2`.

Step 4. `InternshipParser` then calls the `RejectCommandParser#parse` method. In this method, it is ensured that the input is of the correct format, and the argument string is converted to an Index instance.

Step 5. If the index specified by the user is valid then the `RejectCommandParser` creates a new `RejectCommand` instance and returns it to `InternshipParser`, which in turn returns it to `LogicManager`.

Step 6. `LogicManager` then calls the `RejectCommand#execute` method.

Step 7. Next, `RejectCommand` object calls the `Model#setApplication` method with the application to reject and rejected application
as arguments. It then returns a `CommandResult` object to the `LogicManager`.

Step 8. Finally, the `CommandResult` object is returned by the `LogicManager`.

#### Design considerations:

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The default status when an application is added is `Pending`.
  It can later be changed to `Rejected` using the `reject` command.
    * Pros: Convenient for the user to use.
    * Cons: User cannot add an application whose status is already known.

* **Alternative 2:** Provide the ability to specify the status of an application at the time of adding.
    * Pros: Easy to specify the desired status field while adding an application.
    * Cons: The `add` command will require too many parameters.

### Soon feature
The `soon` feature is implemented by the `SoonCommandParser` and `SoonCommand` classes.

`SoonCommandParser` class is responsible for parsing the parameter received from the user.

`SoonCommand` class is responsible for listing the applications whose submission or interview deadlines are within a certain number of days specified by the user.

Below is a sequence diagram and explanation of how the SoonCommand is executed.
![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `soon d/ 1` Command](images/umldiagrams/SoonSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 1. The user enters `soon d/1` command in the main window.

Step 2. The command is handled by `LogicManager#execute` method, which then calls the `InternshipParser#parseCommand` method.

Step 3. `InternshipParser` matches the command word `soon` in the string and extracts the argument string `d/1`.

Step 4. `InternshipParser` then calls `SoonCommandParser#parse` method and the argument string is converted to a Predicate and Index instances.

Step 5. `SoonCommandParser` creates a new `SoonCommand` instance and returns it to `InternshipParser`, which in turn returns it to `LogicManager`.

Step 6. Next, `LogicManager` calls `SoonCommand#execute`.

Step 7. `SoonCommand` calls the `Model#updateFilteredApplicationList` method to update the application panel.

Step 8. `SoonCommand` then creates a `CommandResult` instance and returns it to `LogicManager`.

#### Design considerations:

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Lists applications using a specified field (e.g. user can specify deadline field with d/ or interview field with i/) and number of days.
    * Pros: User can specify a number to see applications that are due within the specified number of days.
    * Cons: The `soon` command will require more parameters.

* **Alternative 2:** List applications whose deadlines are within a pre-set number of days.
    * Pros: Shorter command for user to input.
    * Cons: Does not provide flexibility to the user.

### Find feature
The `find` feature is implemented by the `FindCommandParser` and `FindCommand` classes.

`FindCommandParser` class is responsible for parsing the parameter received from the user.

`FindCommand` class is responsible for finding the matching applications with specified fields according to the given syntax and keyword.

Below is a sequence diagram and explanation of how the FindCommand is executed.
![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `find pr/High` Command](images/umldiagrams/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 1. The user enters `find pr/High` command in the main window.

Step 2. The command is handled by `LogicManager#execute` method, which then calls the `InternshipParser#parseCommand` method.

Step 3. The `InternshipParser` matches the command word `find` in the string and extracts the argument string `pr/High`.

Step 4. The `InternshipParser` then calls `FindCommandParser#parse` method and the argument string is converted to a List.

Step 5. The `FindCommandParser` creates a new `PriorityContainsKeywordsPredicate` instance with the priority List to handle the filter.
 
Step 6. The `FindCommandParser` creates a new `FindCommand` instance with the `PriorityContainsKeywordsPredicate` instance and returns it to `InternshipParser`, which in turn returns it to `LogicManager`.

Step 7. The `LogicManager` calls the `FindCommand#execute` method.

Step 8. The `FindCommand` calls the `Model#updateFilteredApplicationList` method and filters applications by priority High.

Step 9. The application lists the filtered applications that match the given field and keyword.

Step 10. `FindCommand` then creates a `CommandResult` and returns it to `LogicManager`.

#### Design considerations:

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Matches applications using specified fields (e.g. user can specify deadline field with d/) and keywords.
    * Pros: User can specify fields to match similar to the way in `AddCommand` and `EditCommand`.
    * Cons: The `find` command will require more parameters.

* **Alternative 2:** Uses different command word for finding different fields (e.g. findD for matching application with deadlines).
    * Pros: Shorter command for user to input.
    * Cons: Harder for user to remember the command word as this format is not used in other methods.

### Sort feature

The `sort` command is facilitated by the `SortCommand` class. It extends the `Command` class and implements the `SortCommand#execute` method which wraps the main logic of the command. This command can be used to sort the **currently displayed** list of applications according to the specified field.

The `SortCommandParser` class is responsible for parsing the field received from the user. This class implements the `Parser` interface. The `SortCommandParser#parse` method of this class parses the field and returns a `SortCommand` object with the field as the parameter.

Below is a sequence diagram and explanation of how the SortCommand is executed.
![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `sort pr/` Command](images/umldiagrams/SortSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 1. The user enters `sort pr/` command in the main window.

Step 2. The command is handled by `LogicManager#execute` method, which then calls the `InternshipParser#parseCommand` method.

Step 3. `InternshipParser` matches the command word `sort` in the string and extracts the argument string `pr/`.

Step 4. `InternshipParser` then calls `SortCommandParser#parse` method and the argument string is converted to a Parameter instance.

Step 5. `SortCommandParser` creates a new `SortCommand` instance and returns it to `InternshipParser`, which in turn returns it to `LogicManager`.

Step 6. Next, `LogicManager` calls the `SortCommand#execute`.

Step 7. `SortCommand` calls the `Model#setInternship` method to sort the application list by priority.

Step 8. The application shows the sorted list.

Step 9. `SortCommand` then creates a `CommandResult` and returns it to `Logic Manager`.

#### Design considerations:

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only allow lists to be sorted in one direction per field (e.g. sooner to later for deadline, alphabetically for company name)
    * Pros: Easier to implement. The implemented direction of sorting is also the more logical one (users are unlikely to want to view their applications from lower to higher priority).
    * Cons: The user cannot specify the direction of sorting (e.g. later deadlines first).

* **Alternative 2:** Provide the option to specify the field to sort the list by as well as the direction of sorting.
    * Pros: Users have more options on how to view their list of applications.
    * Cons: The `sort` command will require more parameters.

### Undo/Redo feature

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedInternship`. It extends `Internship` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `internshipStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedInternship#commit` — Saves the current internship state in its history.
* `VersionedInternship#undo` — Restores the previous internship state from its history.
* `VersionedInternship#redo` — Restores a previously undone internship state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitInternship`, `Model#undoInternship` and `Model#redoInternship` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedInternship` will be initialized with the initial Internship state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single Internship state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/umldiagrams/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th application in the Internship. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitInternship`, causing the modified state of the Internship after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `internshipStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted Internship state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/umldiagrams/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add c/Amazon …​` to add a new application. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitInternship`, causing another modified Internship state to be saved into the `internshipStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/umldiagrams/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitInternship`, so the Internship state will not be saved into the `internshipStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the application was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoInternship`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous Internship state, and restores the Internship to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/umldiagrams/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial Internship state, then there are no previous Internship states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoInternship` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/umldiagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoInternship`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the Internship to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `internshipStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest Internship state, then there are no undone Internship states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoInternship()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the Internship, such as `list`, `help`, `find`, will usually not call `Model#commitInternship`, `Model#undoInternship` or `Model#redoInternship`. Thus, the `internshipStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/umldiagrams/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitInternship`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `internshipStateList`, all Internship states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add c/Amazon` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/umldiagrams/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/umldiagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire Internship.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the application being deleted).
    * Cons: Must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## Appendix 3: Effort

If the effort required to create **AB3** is 10, we would place the effort level required to implement the current version of **InternSHIP** at 15.

Our team has put in a significant amount of effort to get InternSHIP to the current version. Below, we list some notable changes overall and notable features implemented by us.

### Notable changes in general

1. **Morphed existing AB3 to align with our design for InternSHIP**

   We have put in a significant amount of effort morphing the existing code base, AB3 to support the need of our application, which is about internship data management.

   Firstly, we had to create new classes for fields related to an internship application, such as `Company`, `Position`, `Deadline`, `Requirements`, `InterviewDateAndTime`, `Priority`, `Completion` and `Status`. Each of these classes have different input format requirements and are related to different commands.

   Secondly, we had to remove all the irrelevant classes and update the existing test cases to fit our need.

   Lastly, we had to integrate all these new classes with the existing code to save applications to a data file in InternSHIP. This required major refactoring of existing classes to support multiple new fields and commands.


2. **Redesigned GUI**

   Compared to AB3, InternSHIP displays each field of an internship application under a separate column. The entire internship list is displayed in a vertical list where each adjacent entry is highlighted with a different shade of blue.

   In addition, the project icon and overall GUI colour scheme were carefully chosen and designed to represent our value proposition. InternSHIP will help its users navigate through the sea of internship applications for their voyage to their desired company.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Notable Features

Notable features we implemented from scratch include Complete, Accept, Reject, Sort, Find, Soon and Undo/Redo. We came up with these features as they fit well in helping our target users solve problems they may encounter in their internship data management.

The implementation details and design considerations for these features can be found in the [Implementation](#implementation) section.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Appendix 4: Limitations and Future improvements

We acknowledge the fact that our current product is not perfect, and it still has room for improvement.
Below are some limitations and future improvements of our product.

### Limitations
1. **Commands not accepting multiple fields**

    Currently, our product does not support the functionality of accepting multiple fields. For example:
   - `find c/DBS p/programmer`
   - `soon d/7 i/20`
   - `sort c/ d/`<br>
   The above commands will produce an error message, stating that the commands are invalid. This is because our initial implementation would only take one field (e.g c/) and ignore the rest. Thus, the workaround for this issue is to not allow the users to enter multiple fields.
     
2. **Invalid prefix resulting in an unexpected error message**

   As pointed out in PE-D, our current product is not able to check for a typo in the prefixes. For example:
   - `edit 1 c/Grab zp/Engineer`<br>
   The example above will produce an error message, stating that the company name should contain only alphanumeric characters. This is because our current implementation takes `zp/Engineer` as a part of the company name.
     
### Future Improvements

1. **Commands not accepting multiple fields**

    This limitation could be improved by accepting both fields and showing the application(s) that satisfy both criteria. For example, `find c/DBS p/programmer`  should show application(s) whose company name is "DBS" and position is "programmer".
   
2. **Invalid prefix resulting in an unexpected error message**
  
   This limitation could be improved by checking if the fields entered by the users match any of the valid prefixes. Perhaps, for every `/` found, the preceding character(s) could be checked against all the valid prefixes.
